# js-biglietto-treno-form

I believe one of the most important thing Riccardo has tought us is how to read the documentation of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and now JS. Research is a great deal. Anything can be achieved with the tools he provided. I've tried, without success, to do this on my own. 

I guess the homework looks pretty good. I am sure there are better and more efficient ways to do what I have done, but playing arround a little with JS really made my day!
